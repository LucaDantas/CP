We have an undirected weighted graph

Compute the minimum price to see the show (cost a_i on each city) starting from every city on the graph, and you have to go and then come back cost 2*w_i per edge

approach: start a multisource dijkstra with every single city starting with the value to watch the show there and find the "Shortest path" to every other city, which in this case won't be a real path but when we "relax" a path we are saying that it is better to start in another city and then go to the one we're analyzing in the moment

In the end just print the "shortest path" or "distance" in the conventional dijkstra of each vertex
